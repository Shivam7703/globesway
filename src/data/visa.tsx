Candidates must score at least 67 out of 100 points based on six key selection factors. These include education, language ability, work experience, age, arranged employment in Canada, and adaptability. Unlike CRS, this system is not comparative —it’s a pass/fail type check.

Use the 67 points calculator as your first filter —if you clear it, then prepare for the CRS stage. If not, then focus on upgrading qualifications or language skills. Many applicants fail to get ITAs simply because they misunderstood these eligibility steps.",
